#R7.University

Modules and base library for DNN Platfrom CMS designed to present and manage various assets 
(divisions, employees) for high school education website. 


**NOTE**: From version 1.0.4 R7.University uses [R7.ImageHandler](https://github.com/roman-yagodin/R7.ImageHandler) 
to generate photo thumbnails (but not absolutely require it). Url format for thumbnails is http://www.somewhere.com/imagehandler.ashx?fileid=XXX&width=YYY, so you can also use / adapt [BBImageHandler] (http://bbimagehandler.codeplex.com/) or others.

From version 1.0.6 R7.University uses [R7.ImageHandler](https://github.com/roman-yagodin/R7.ImageHandler) 
to generate QR-codes for division contact vCards.

#TODO

* Support schema.org formats
* Allow export contacts in vCard format
* Allow manage multiple organizations
* Add organization-level configuration options
* Add more useful modules
* Many other things
